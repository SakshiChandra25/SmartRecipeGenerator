The Smart Recipe Generator uses a straightforward client-server model. The React frontend provides a simple and clean interface with a single input box that asks users what they want to cook. Upon submission, the frontend sends the query to the Express backend API, which interacts with the MySQL database. The backend searches for recipes in the database that match the userâ€™s input by title, retrieves corresponding ingredients via SQL joins, and returns the data in JSON format. The frontend then dynamically displays the recipe title, ingredients, and step-by-step cooking instructions. Bootstrap is used for responsive, minimal styling. This approach ensures a lightweight and fast experience without complex authentication or navigation components, focusing purely on functionality and usability.
